            <p> Hello! <br>
            <p> It is Greg, reaching to you from The Coder School. I hope you are doing well today!<br>
            <p> I am sorry for distracting you in the evening. The reason for this email is that our database is missing
                {name}'s school name. I will appreciate it if you can send it to me, so I can update it. <br><br>

                Thank you very much in advance! Have a great evening. <br><br></p>


            <p> Best Regards,<br>
                Greg Podoksik <br>
