            <p> Hello {name}! <br>
                I am Greg, reaching to you from The Coder School. <br>

            <p> I saw that your kid had a trial class with us, but has not signed up yet. I was wondering if you would <br>
                be still interested in that. I also wanted to pay your attention at the 50% discount for all classes we <br>
                offer to the students who join before May 31st. <br> <br>

                In case that for any reason you are not able or willing to join our code coaching or group class programs <br>
                (or in addition to them), we offer summer camps which you can sign up for. We teach various coding fields, <br>
                starting from game development and ethical hacking, and ending at machine learning and robotics. <br>

            <p> Let me know if you would like to sign up for any of our programs!

            <p> Thank you! <br><br></p>


            <p> Best Regards,<br>
                Greg Podoksik - Code Coordinator <br>
