            <p> Hello {name}! <br>

            <p> I am Greg, reaching to you from The Coder School. <br>
                We are currently enrolling new students into our Code Coaching and Group Class programs. <br>

            <p> We teach coding through immersion: coaches guide students through development of the projects they want to bring to life. <br>
                Our Code Coaching programs feature small student to teacher ratios (2:1 or less), giving your child personal attention. <br>

            <p> As an alternative to Code Coaching, we offer Group Classes in Scratch or Python.  <br>
                In larger groups of 3-4, group classes cover coding concepts and problem solving for beginners who may not yet know if coding is the right fit for them.

            <p> We are available for multiple sessions a week, and have seen students taking advantage of the current lockdown to progress faster through their goals. <br>
                By signing up, you will also get access to our new exclusive platform for homework project ideas called AppStream. <br>

            <p> For all students who join until the end of May, we offer a 50% discount for the first month of classes. <br>
                We also offer various summer camps that you can learn more about on our website (see links below).

            <p> Let me know if you are interested in signing up for any of our programs or camps! <br> <br> <br>

                Thank you! <br><br></p>


            <p> Best Regards,<br>
                Greg Podoksik - Code Coordinator <br>
