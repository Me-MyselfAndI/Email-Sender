            <p> Hello {name}! <br>
            <p> I am Greg, reaching to you from The Coder School. <br>
            <p> We are currently enrolling new children for our Code Coaching and Group Class programs. <br>
            <p> Our Code Coaching programs feature small student to teacher ratios, giving your child focused guidance through projects they want to come to life. <br>
            <p> We also offer group sessions in Scratch/Python that cover coding concepts and problem solving for any beginners that may not yet know if coding is right for them. <br>
            <p> We are available for multiple sessions a week, and have seen students taking advantage of the current lock down to progress faster through their goals. <br>
            <p> By signing up now, you will also get access to our new exclusive platform for homework project ideas called AppStream. <br>
            <p> We also offer an additional lab hour every week on Wednesdays at 5pm for up to 10 Code Coaching students on a first come first serve basis. <br>
            <p> We offer different promotions, one of which is 50% off of all classes in April. <br>
            <p> I've attached our CoderTree to illustrate the need for a strong foundation before tackling higher level coding concepts. <br>
            <p> I've also attached our Progress Tracking flyer to better explain how you can track your child's progress. <br>
            <p> Please let me know if you are interested in signing up, and we can add you to the schedule as soon as next week. <br> <br> <br>

                Thank you! <br><br></p>


            <p> Best Regards,<br>
                Greg Podoksik - Code Coordinator <br>
