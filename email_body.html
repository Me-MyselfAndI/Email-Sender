            <p> Good afternoon {parent},
            <p> This is Greg, {kid}'s instructor from TheCoderSchool. I apologize for the inconvenience that this may create, but I will not be able to teach classes tomorrow.
            <p> Would that work for you to make up this class at 4 PM on Friday? If not, let me know when you would prefer to make up the class.

            <p> Thank you, and again, I am sorry for the inconvenience.



            <p> Best Regards, <br>
            <p> Greg Podoksik - Code Coordinator <br>
